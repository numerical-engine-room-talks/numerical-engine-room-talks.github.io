A particular focus in these talks is on the internals of the &quot;numerical engine room&quot;, i.e., on details such as implementation notes, performance numbers, or specific corner cases. We invite our guest speakers and the audience to engage in discussions at this level, to facilitate a scientific exchange that goes beyond the polished results found in the literature.</p> <p>We host the Numerical Engine Room Talks on a semi-regular basis, approximately once every month or two, via Zoom. If you are interested, please send an email to <a href="mailto:m.schlottke-lakemper@acom.rwth-aachen.de">Michael</a> to be included in the regular announcement email.</p> <p>Michael Schlottke-Lakemper, <a href="https://lakemper.eu">RWTH Aachen University</a><br/> Gregor Gassner, <a href="https://www.mi.uni-koeln.de/NumSim">University of Cologne</a><br/> Hendrik Ranocha, <a href="https://ranocha.de">University of Hamburg</a></p> <p><hr /> <em><a href="https://github.com/uekerman">Benjamin Uekermann</a> &#40;University of Stuttgart&#41;</em><br/> <strong>preCICE â€“ A General-Purpose Simulation Coupling Interface</strong><br/> <em>Friday, 21st April 2023, 11am CET</em><br/></p> <p><a href="https://precice.org/">preCICE</a> is an open-source coupling software for partitioned multi-physics and multi-scale simulations. Thanks to the software&#39;s library approach &#40;the simulations call the coupling&#41; and its high-level API, only minimally-invasive changes are required to prepare an existing &#40;legacy&#41; simulation software for coupling. Moreover, ready-to-use adapters for many popular simulation software packages are available, e.g. for OpenFOAM, SU2, CalculiX, FEniCS, and deal.II. For the actual coupling, preCICE offers methods for fixed-point acceleration &#40;quasi-Newton acceleration&#41;, fully parallel communication &#40;MPI or TCP/IP&#41;, data mapping &#40;radial-basis function interpolation&#41;, and time interpolation &#40;waveform relaxation&#41;. Today, although being an academic software project at heart, preCICE is used by more than 100 research groups in both academia and industry.</p> <p><hr /> <em><a href="https://vchuravy.dev/">Valentin Churavy</a> &#40;MIT&#41;</em><br/> <strong>Compiler based automatic differentiation for scientific programs</strong><br/> <em>Friday, 16th December 2022, 10am CET</em><br/></p> <p>Automatic differentiation is a powerful technique in numerical computing. In this talk we will explore the tradeoffs of implementing AD on different levels, and discuss automatic differentiation for parallel programs and high-level programming languages. The particular focus will be on Enzyme an AD framework that operates on the compiler level and supports reverse and forward mode AD in a variety of languages such as Julia, C/C&#43;&#43;, Fortran and others.</p> <p>This talk is based on the paper &quot;Scalable Automatic Differentiation of Multiple Parallel Paradigms through Compiler Augmentation&quot; by Moses et al. &#40;<a href="https://www.computer.org/csdl/proceedings-article/sc/2022/544400a859/1I0bT5ygZby">PDF</a>, Winner of the Best Student Paper Award at SC22&#41;.</p> <p><hr /> <em><a href="https://www.epc.ed.tum.de/aer/mitarbeiter-innen/cv-2/a-d/m-sc-deniz-bezgin/">Deniz Bezgin</a> &#40;TU Munich&#41;, <a href="https://www.epc.ed.tum.de/aer/mitarbeiter-innen/cv-2/a-d/m-sc-aaron-buhendwa/">Aaron Buhendwa</a> &#40;TU Munich&#41;</em><br/> <strong>Differentiable Fluid Dynamics in JAX: Challenges and Perspectives</strong><br/> <em>Friday, 26th August 2022, 10am CEST</em><br/></p> <p>JAX-FLUIDS is a CFD solver written in Python, which uses the JAX framework to enable automatic differentiation &#40;AD&#41;. This allows one to easily create applications for data-driven simulations or other optimization problems. The talk is based on the recent preprint &quot;JAX-FLUIDS: A fully-differentiable high-order computational fluid dynamics solver for compressible two-phase flows&quot; <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.13760">arXiv:2203.13760</a>.</p> <div class=page-foot > <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/">CC BY-SA 4.0</a> Michael Schlottke-Lakemper.
