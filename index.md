The *Numerical Engine Room Talks* are an interdisciplinary seminar series at the
intersection of numerical methods, algorithm development, and high-performance
computing. A particular focus in these talks is on the internals of the
"numerical engine room", i.e., on details such as implementation notes,
performance numbers, or specific corner cases. We invite our guest speakers
and the audience to engage in discussions at this level, to facilitate a
scientific exchange that goes beyond the polished results found in the
literature.

We host the Numerical Engine Room Talks on a semi-regular basis, approximately
once every month or two, via Zoom. If you are interested, please send an email to
[Michael](mailto:m.schlottke-lakemper@acom.rwth-aachen.de)
to be included in the regular announcement email.

**Differentiable Fluid Dynamics in JAX: Challenges and Perspectives**\\
*Friday, 26 August 2022, 10am CEST*\\

JAX-FLUIDS is a CFD solver written in Python, which uses the JAX framework to
enable automatic differentiation (AD). This allows one to easily create
applications for data-driven simulations or other optimization problems. The
talk is based on the recent preprint "JAX-FLUIDS: A fully-differentiable
high-order computational fluid dynamics solver for compressible two-phase
flows" [arXiv:2203.13760](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.13760).
